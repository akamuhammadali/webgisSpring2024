    <h1>Quaid-e-Azam</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong>, commonly known as <strong>Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader)</strong>, was a Pakistani statesman and a lawyer who is widely regarded as the founder of Pakistan. Born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, British India (now Pakistan), he played a pivotal role in the independence movement of India and the creation of Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims.

    <h2>Early Days of Quaid-e-Azam</h2>
    <p>
        Muhammad Ali Jinnah had a remarkable early life. He received his early education in Karachi and then moved to London for higher studies. He excelled in academics and law, becoming a successful barrister in Bombay. He entered politics and became a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity. However, disillusioned by the Congress' stance on Muslim rights, he eventually joined the All India Muslim League and led the demand for a separate nation for Muslims, which culminated in the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
